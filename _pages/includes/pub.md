[Learning Decoupling Features Through Orthogonality Regularization](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9747878) \\
**Li Wang**, Rongzhi Gu, Weiji Zhuang, Peng Gao, Yujun Wang, Yuexian Zou

- This paper is committed to improving the model performance of personalized keyword spotting (identifying keywords and speakers) tasks. This paper believes that the key of personalized keyword spotting task is how to effectively extract the features shared by two tasks and decouple the features related to tasks. This paper creatively uses orthogonal regularization to constrain the model to decouple keyword information and speaker information.

[Text Anchor Based Metric Learning for Small-Footprint Keyword Spotting](https://www.isca-speech.org/archive/interspeech_2021/wang21da_interspeech.html) \\
**Li Wang**, Rongzhi Gu, Nuo Chen, Yuexian Zou

- Innovatively propose a measurement learning method based on text anchor, and use BERT to generate embedding with rich semantic information, so that the model can understand the semantic information of keywords.
